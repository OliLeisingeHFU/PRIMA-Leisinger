## 0. Units and Position
I have chosen the diameter of the pinball as the 1, since the ball is the object that interacts with all other objects, and the most important object when it comes to spacing, for example the spacing between the flippers.
0 is located right below the tip of the flippers in reverse flip position, as there is no way to save the ball from that point on. This makes programing easier, there is no need for a "Death Zone" that is programmed, if the ball can't be interacted with, when its Y coordinate is below 0.
The X-Axis' 0 is in the middle between the flippers, simply to make symmetry easier.

1. Every Object, aside from the Spring are categorized and easy to find. The Spring does not necessarily need to be categorized. 
Initially it seems having a single Ball inside the Balls node seems like the Balls node is unnecessary, but doing this simplifies the work needed to implement the Multiball power up.
2. Since the Coins 1-5 are in their own node, they are easily replaced using a loop.
3. After the Arena was built upright during development, all that was needed to give it the same angle as a real Pinball machine, was to rotate the Arenas ComponentTransform. This makes proper positioning of objects easier, both before and after the Arena was rotated.

## 2. Editor
The Arena is built using the Editor. This is much easier than using code if you build something that is not symmetrical, especially if someone, like me, is not that good at imagining how it will look. But it's still fairly simple when making a symmetrical environment. That is why all ComponentTransforms are added in the editor by hand, as they were used to build the environment. ComponentRigidBody on the other hand is easier to use in code, because I have several of the same object in different places. that way adding colliders by code and having them be the same is easier than doing it by hand. Testing and changing values is also faster using code.
